# EV-Charging-Station-Optimization

In this project, we addressed the complex optimization problem of strategically installing electric vehicle (EV) charging plugs in public parking lots across Chicago Downtown, specifically in the zip code area 60601, 60602, 60603, and 60604. With the growing adoption of EVs, there is an increasing demand for accessible and efficient charging infrastructure. Our objective was to develop a model that minimizes both the number of charging plugs installed and the number of parking lots modified, thereby reducing costs and environmental impacts.

Our research methodology involved formulating a mixed-integer multi-objective linear programming (MILP) model, incorporating variables for fast and slow charging plugs and binary decisions for initiating installations. Parameters such as the capacity of parking lots, the charging efficiencies of plugs, and average energy usage per mile of EVs were crucial inputs. We utilized network analysis to consider the cumulative effect of multiple nearby parking lots on demand satisfaction and distribution limits.

The major outcomes of our project include a guide for successful placement of charging stations that meet the projected EV demand without exceeding the energy capacities of parking lots. Furthermore, the proposed configuration enhances coverage and accessibility for EV users, promoting wider EV adoption. Only 8 additional chargers were necessary to meet our demand constraints. The study also highlighted the importance of strategic planning in the placement of EV infrastructure and demonstrated the efficacy of MILP in solving large-scale network-based optimization problems in urban planning.
